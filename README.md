# rand-float-rs

This crate implements several techniques for generating uniform random
floating-point numbers in [0 . . 1) from a stream of random bits.

The motivation was the state of disarray of the literature on the topic:
academic papers, GitHub repositories, and free-floating sources, often lacking
comparison with other approaches, a few bugs, a in some cases definitely hostile
notation.

Every technique is implemented as a pure transformation of a source of
uniform random 64-bit words (any `FnMut() -> u64`), documented with its
exact output distribution, and benchmarked against the others.

The translation from the sources in different languages was operated by Fable
and extensively checked against the original implementation. In the process, we
isolated a few bugs in the original code, that have been reported to the
authors.

struct Xoroshiro128pp([u64; 2]);

        s1 ^= s0;
        self.0 = [s0.rotate_left(49) ^ s1 ^ (s1 << 21), s1.rotate_left(28)];

```

## Benchmarks

`cargo bench` drives every technique with the same Weyl-sequence source in two
settings: one conversion per call, and filling an array of 1024 doubles per
iteration.

On CPUs with heterogeneous cores, pin the run to one core (build first so
compilation stays parallel):

```sh
cargo bench --no-run
taskset -c 2 cargo bench   # Linux; pick a performance core
```

To run the benchmarks and turn the results into a bar chart (ns per
generated `f64`, single-call and array-fill bars side by side; requires
Python with matplotlib) in one line:

```sh
cargo bench 2>&1 | python3 python/plot_bench.py -o bench.pdf
```

The output format follows the extension (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.svg`, ...), and
the script also accepts a previously saved log: `python3
python/plot_bench.py bench.txt -o bench.pdf`.
