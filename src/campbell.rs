//! Taylor R. Campbell’s correctly rounded uniform doubles.
//!
//! A Rust port of `binary64fast.c` (Campbell, 2014–2026) and of the
//! `random_real` function of
//! [`random_real.c`](https://mumble.net/~campbell/2014/04/28/random_real.c)
//! (Campbell, 2014). These functions return an `f64` distributed as a uniform
//! real in [0 . . 1] correctly rounded to nearest. The `binary64fast.c`
//! functions ([`fast`] and the const-time variants) stop after two exponent
//! words, so they reach every float in [2⁻¹²⁸ . . 1], each with
//! probability equal to the measure of the reals that round to it, except
//! that the reals below 2⁻¹²⁸ (probability 2⁻¹²⁸) are folded into the bottom
//! binade. In particular, 0 never occurs: [`real`] keeps consuming words,
//! and reaches every float in [2⁻¹⁰²⁴ . . 1], plus 0 (see its documentation
//! for why the smaller subnormals cannot occur).
//!
//! Two variants handle the zero-`m` event without data-dependent branching, for
//! use where timing side channels matter; they unconditionally consume three
//! words per call. The `cmov` variant is a modification of mine in which the
//! “bit smearing“ technique of the original C is replaced by a comparison that
//! the compiler can turn into a conditional-move instruction (Taylor does not
//! want to rely on the compiler for the absence of tests, but the smearing is
//! much slower.)
//!
//! If you compare generated code with older copies of `binary64fast.c` you
//! might find a signed where an unsigned integer-to-double conversion
//! instruction was present: Taylor fixed the code after I reported the
//! possibility of a branchy unsigned conversion on pre-AVX-512 x86.
